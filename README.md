Reflection:            
When doing this activity, I learned about the cube map and deepened my understanding of shaders and their languages in Unity. I became familiar with creating materials and attaching textures to them, then attaching the materials to the game objects. I also finally fixed a problem I was having with the render pipeline, which made it much easier for me to do this activity. I also realized my understanding and experience of using shaders are not as good, as I get thrown off quickly and easily.
